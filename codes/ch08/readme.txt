=========================== Description ====================================

This prototype is a portal for managing newspaper sales and distribution. 
The system caters to several newspaper organizations for marketing, sales, 
and content management. The system requires each organization to register their 
respective representative(s) for the login credentials to access the system. 
After user approval, the representative can manage and approve the content of 
their daily issue based on the agreed budget and scopes. The application has 
services that can monitor sales periodically and create a pool of messengers 
paid to deliver the papers to different outlets. Moreover, the system can track 
customers and the outlets where they bought their newspapers. The prototype is 
an initial attempt to create a platform for a newspaper management portal.

This application uses the FastAPI framework driven by Python 3.8.
This application now involves data storage using PostgreSQL 13. 
The backup database schema is in the /database folder of the project.

The requirements.txt will guide you with the dependencies. Just install by running:
