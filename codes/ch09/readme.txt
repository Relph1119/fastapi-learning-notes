menu, and hospitality. Aside from survey systems, the application can provide a 
nominal and numerical approach to the rating system. Overall, the prototype can 
be a foundation for a scalable survey system.

This application uses the FastAPI framework driven by Python 3.8.
This application now involves data storage using MongoDb 5.x. 
The backup database schema is in the /database folder of the project.
