Application Name: Online Restaurant Review System

=========================== Description ====================================

The prototype is about gathering poverty-related data from a sample size of 
respondents. The project has two microservices: the ch10-relational, which uses 
a relational database, and the ch10-mongo, which uses the NoSQL database. 
The ch10-relational features only highlight descriptive statistics, plotting 
of data, formulation of linear and nonlinear models, and solving the roots of 
the models. The transactions in this project utilize mainly the NumPy, pandas, 
scipy, and matplotlib modules. On the other hand, the ch10-mongo focuses on 
workflow using Celery and Redis, GraphQL with graphene 3, and Ne04J operations. 
The prototypes can still be enhanced and expanded to cater to more mathematical 
and symbolic computations.

This application uses the FastAPI framework driven by Python 3.8.
This application now involves data storage using MongoDb 5.x. 
The backup database schema is in the /database folder of the project.
