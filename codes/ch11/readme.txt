The prototype is supposed to manage players, officials, and the games they are 
involved. It must also create a schedule for the games using various sports 
algorithms. But due to time constraints, the implementation focused on the 
FastAPI platform creation with some other microservice features like OpenTracing, 
Service Registry, Client service discovery, API health checks, and integration 
with Flask and Django.

This project focuses on the FastAPI project. Check the other ch11 projects for the
